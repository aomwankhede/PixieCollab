# PixieColab

## Overview
PixieColab is a MERN stack application designed to solve a common challenge faced by vloggers: unreliable internet connections during video uploads. By providing a secure and efficient platform, PixieColab ensures that vloggers can seamlessly upload videos to their YouTube channels without compromising their credentials. The application fosters collaboration between vloggers and their editors, streamlining the content creation and upload process.

## Problem Statement
Uploading high-quality videos to YouTube requires a stable internet connection, which is not always available, especially for vloggers working in remote or inconsistent network environments. Editors, on the other hand, are assumed to have access to reliable internet connections. This assumption forms the foundation of PixieColab, where editors play a key role in uploading videos on behalf of vloggers. 

While the platform primarily focuses on vloggers, it can be extended to benefit other communities facing similar challenges, such as educators, content creators, or businesses in regions with poor internet connectivity.

PixieColab addresses these challenges by:

1. **Facilitating Secure Collaboration**: Editors can upload videos on behalf of vloggers without requiring access to their credentials.
2. **Ensuring Timely Uploads**: The platform minimizes delays caused by poor internet connectivity on the vlogger’s side.
3. **Preserving Control**: Vloggers retain full control over their content and YouTube accounts.

## Key Features
- **Google Authentication (GAuth)**: Secure authentication and authorization using YouTube API.
- **Role-based Access**: Separate interfaces and permissions for vloggers and editors.
- **Video Review Process**: Editors upload drafts that vloggers can review before finalizing uploads.
- **Queue Management**: Handles uploads in a queue to avoid conflicts and optimize the process.
- **Real-time Status Updates**: Provides progress tracking for video uploads.
